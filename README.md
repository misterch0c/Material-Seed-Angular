# Material Angular Seed (using Yeoman generator)



## Usage

!!You only need to install yo if you want to use the  generators!!

Install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, `bower`, `generator-angular` and `generator-karma`:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview
```

## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular:controller](#controller)
* [angular:directive](#directive)
* [angular:filter](#filter)
* [angular:route](#route)
* [angular:service](#service)
* [angular:provider](#service)
* [angular:factory](#service)
* [angular:value](#service)
* [angular:constant](#service)
* [angular:decorator](#decorator)
* [angular:view](#view)



### Route
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

**Explicitly provide route URI**

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myRoute --uri=my/route
```

Produces controller and view as above and adds a route to `app/scripts/app.js`
with URI `my/route`

### Controller
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### View
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').service('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

You can also do `yo angular:factory`, `yo angular:provider`, `yo angular:value`, and `yo angular:constant` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:decorator serviceName
```

Produces `app/scripts/decorators/serviceNameDecorator.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').config(function ($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('serviceName', function ($delegate) {
      // ...
      return $delegate;
    });
  });
```

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

A project can mix CoffeScript and JavaScript files.

To output JavaScript files, even if CoffeeScript files exist (the default is to output CoffeeScript files if the generator finds any in the project), use `--coffee=false`.

### Minification Safe

**tl;dr**: You don't need to write annotated code as the build step will
handle it for you.

By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations that make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ng-annotate`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use it, you have to add these annotations manually yourself. Why would you do that though? If you find a bug
in the annotated code, please file an issue at [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate/issues).


### Add to Index
By default, new scripts are added to the index.html file. However, this may not always be suitable. Some use cases:

* Manually added to the file
* Auto-added by a 3rd party plugin
* Using this generator as a subgenerator

To skip adding them to the index, pass in the skip-add argument:
```bash
yo angular:service serviceName --skip-add
